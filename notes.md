## Notes

Notes taken while developing this, which may be useful to improve the ecosystem.

- changing y-up to z-up is not too obvious
  - rapier configuration could be better (changing gravity requires a setup system) (insert the whole configuration for its setup?)
- Reflect capability is really missing for making editors quickly.

## TODO

- share an asset folder (use `BEVY_ASSET_ROOT`)
- integrate the map to the sandbox
- make better controllable vehicles
- be able to load rocks into truck with the excavator
