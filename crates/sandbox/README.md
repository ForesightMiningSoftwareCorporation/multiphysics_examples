# Sandbox

This crate is a showcase of what's possible using the other crates of this repository.

While it's a good start, it's isolated so you can start multiple projects quickly.

In a hackathon it may be useful to have multiple sandboxes for each experiment,
then merge the interesting parts once ready.
